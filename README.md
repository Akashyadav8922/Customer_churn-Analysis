# Customer_churn-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn to help businesses understand why customers leave and identify strategies to improve retention. Using Power BI, I developed an interactive dashboard that provides insights into churn patterns, customer behavior, and key factors driving attrition.
Objectives
Identify customers at high risk of churn.
Analyze demographic and behavioral patterns influencing churn.
Provide actionable insights to improve retention strategies.
Enable stakeholders to interact with data through a user-friendly dashboard.

📊 Dashboard Features
The Power BI dashboard includes the following key components:
KPI Cards → Overall churn rate, active vs. churned customers, average tenure.
Demographics Analysis → Churn by gender, contract type.
Services Breakdown → Churn based on subscribed services (Internet, Phone, Streaming, etc.).
Payment & Tenure Analysis → Impact of billing methods and contract duration on churn.
Interactive Filters & Slicers → Drill-down by customer segments, time, and services.
